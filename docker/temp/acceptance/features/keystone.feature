    Scenario: 01: Verify the response of administrator token
      Given a valid tenantName, username and password
      And a connectivity to the Keystone service
      When I request a valid token from the Keystone
      Then the keystone return me a json message with a valid token

    Scenario: 02: Get the list of trial users
      Given a valid token from the Keystone
      When I request a list of trial users from the Keystone
      Then the Keystone returns a list with all the trial users registered

    Scenario: 03: Get the list of expired users
      Given a valid token from the Keystone
      And a list of trial users from the Keystone
      When I request a list of expired users
      Then the component returns a list with all the expired trial users

    Scenario Outline: 04: Request a token with invalid data
      Given a wrong "<tenantName>", "<username>" or "<password>"
      And a connectivity to the Keystone service

      Then the component return an exception with the message "<message>"
